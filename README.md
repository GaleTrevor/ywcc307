Individual Presentation<br>
This is a read me file for me ywcc 307 presentation.<br>
<br>
My presentation was about the Optimization of CPUs and GPUs in physics engines.<br>
I described what the CPU and GPU were and their jobs in a computer. I also described how they coexist in the computer. <br>
I then gave an explanation on how the CPU and GPU effect physicss engines and what they mainly do. <br>
Finally, I gave an example through video and explained how we can optimize these two computer parts for better running physics simulations.
